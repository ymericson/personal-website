    <h4>data sciency work:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Created and integrated database models into a web app to display the Central Utility Plant's energy consumption data in an internal 
            server. The <code>C+</code> web app using shows an input form for NIH engineers to enter and search utility records, and visualizations 
            using <code>R</code>, <code>Qlik</code>, and <code> MS Report Builder</code> summarise energy usage and cost avoidance. For NIH as a 
            <a href="https://datascience.nih.gov/meet-2020-coding-it-forward-civic-digital-fellows" target="_blank">Civic Digital Fellow</a> in summer 2020.
        </li>
        <li>Identified Chicago neighborhoods where affordable housing is most likely to be an issue. Using open local government datasets and 
            machine learning models,  predicted areas with highest increases in price-to-income ratios in several years. Final project for CAPP 30254: 
            Machine Learning for Public Policy.

        </li>
        <li>Made a <code>Django</code> web app that outputs an energy source table and visual representations of state energy consumption trends. 
            The state-level data from US EIA was imported via web scraping and API. Final project for CAPP 30122: Computer Science with Applications 2.

    <h4>other work:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Built this personal website to experiment with lightweight web frameworks. After being involved in several web app projects,
            I wanted to create a simple site from (somewhat) bottom up using <code>Flask</code> without being too concerned with how to do things the “right” way.

        </li>
        <li>Deployed a web-browser automation tool for EAB that logs in, counts, and duplicates orders for student test name purchasing. It was my first introduction to programming and, 
            despite its simplicity, one of my proudest projects. Built primarily using <code>selenium</code> and <code>openpyxl</code>.
