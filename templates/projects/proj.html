  <h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>
  <p>This is a search engine of the energy consumption trends in U.S. states that outputs an energy source table and visual representations of consumption trends over time. It uses a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> web framework to display a search tool interface with data visualization option to look at a particular state or choose to compare with another state its energy consumption patterns and prices in 2017 (the latest year available), as well as historical time series of energy consumption by source. The state-level data for the project was imported from the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/">U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)</a> website via web scraping and API.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Data collecting and schema building scripts:
      <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">webscraper.py</code>: Scrapes 2017 data from EIA website on on [energy consumption by source] (https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/seds-data-complete.php?sid=US). The script crawls the index page and retrieves the datasets of interest for year 2017. The relevant datasets are then saved in the “data” folder.</li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull_api.py</code>: Leverages EIA’s API to retrieve trend data for a longer time period (1960 - 2017), which is not available in a web page format. The relevant datasets are saved in the “data” folder.</li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">db.sql</code>: sql file that converts data retrieved from web scraping and API into a sql3.lite database.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Data visualization/display scripts:
      <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make_2017_graph.py</code>: Python script that creates graphs showing the total energy consumption pattern by state in 2017. All the graphs are created and saved in the “static/graphs” folder. When a user selects a state, we’ll find the correct path of the state’s graph to display.</li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make_1960_2017_graph.py</code>: Python script to create graphs showing the total energy consumption pattern by state for 1960-2017. All the graphs are created and saved in the “static/graphs” folder. When a user selects a state, we’ll find the correct path of the state’s graph to display.</li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make_2017_table.py</code>: Python script that queries data on the total energy consumption pattern by state in 2017 from the database we created above. Convert the data into a formatted table to be displayed when a user selects a state.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Django scripts: 
  Following the standard structure of a Django application, there are 3 main folders:
      <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search</code> folder contains html template and codes to display the correct visualizations selected by the users.</li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static</code> folder contains css style and graphs generated from our data visualization scripts (to be displayed as static components in css structure).</li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ui</code> folder contains Django default setup and scripts.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
